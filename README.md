# Face Extractor API

This project lets you upload a scanned ID or passport and returns the portrait face — either as a cropped image or base64 string. It’s built using FastAPI and OpenCV, and everything runs in-memory (nothing gets saved).

## 🔗 Live Demo

Here’s the public API (running on ngrok):  
**https://7c48a516a154.ngrok-free.app/docs**

You can try both endpoints:
- `/extract/base64` → returns the face as base64
- `/extract/image` → returns the cropped image

---

## 💡 What It Does

- Detects the largest face in an image
- Crops it and returns the result
- Works best on scanned IDs, passports, or profile-like images
- Fast, lightweight, and doesn’t store anything

- Pillow
- NumPy
- pyngrok

## 📌 Why I Built It

Cropping faces manually is annoying and repetitive. I wanted something simple that could do it in one API call — especially for scanned documents like IDs or passports, and for things like onboarding workflows.
